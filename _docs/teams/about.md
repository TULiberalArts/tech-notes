[Microsoft Teams][8] is a hub for collaborative teamwork in [Office 365][7].
Teams is commonly used to chat directly with individuals or groups, share and
edit files in real time, and host audio and video calls.

Every active account holder at Temple University has access to Office 365 which
includes Microsoft Teams. Since Microsoft Teams is linked directly to
your Temple University AccessNet username, your directory information and
free/busy status is automatically available in Teams.

Teams is available on all major platforms including [Windows][6], [macOS][6],
[GNU/Linux][6], [iOS][5], [Android][5], and the [Web][4]. All of your chat
history and files will synchronize in real time across any device that you use
with Microsoft Teams.

## Channels

In Microsoft Teams, teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests.

Teams are made up of two types of channels — standard (available and visible to everyone) and private (focused, private conversations with a specific audience). Each channel is built around a topic like "Team Events," a department name, or just for fun. Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, and work on files together.

The tabs at the top of each channel link to your favorite files, apps, and services.

It’s important to remember that channels do not have a membership. You don’t
“join” a channel. You join the team. Once you are a member of the team, you can
see all the channels in it unless hidden. 

Learn more about [Teams and Channels][16].

## Posts

The Posts tab is where you post anything you want to say to channel members.

Learn more about [creating and formatting a new post][17] and [how to post a message to multiple channels][18].

## Files

Files that you upload to a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each channel.

Files that you upload to a one-on-one or group chat are stored in your OneDrive for Business folder and are shared only with the people in that conversation. These are available in the Files tab at the top of a chat.

When you upload a file to Teams it is automatically made available to other members of the team. This means multiple people can collaborate on a file at
the same time during a Teams meeting.

Learn more about [collaborating on files in Teams][14] and how to [share files
using Teams][15].

## Apps

Apps let you do more in Teams. Many of the third-party tools, files, and dashboards your organization already uses can be added right into Teams.

Learn more about [using Apps in Microsoft Teams][9].

## Chat

Chat lets you have a private 1:1 conversation with a student or
colleague. You can jump directly into a Teams call, video chat, or add
additional guests to your private chat. Of course, you can also use these same
features from your [Teams mobile app][5] on iOS and Android devices.

Learn more about [starting a chat in Teams][10].

## Calendar

The Calendar app in Teams shows your personal Microsoft calendar. This is the same calendar that is available via Outlook.

To create a Teams meeting, click on Calendar, then New Meeting. Fill out the
Details form and click Send. Teams will automatically add a meeting URL to the
body of the calendar invitation message that will allow attendees to join the
meeting. 

By default, you can invite anyone to a meeting, even if they are not members of
your organization. When it's time to join, clicking on the URL in the
invitation offers the opportunity to launch or download the Teams app, or join
using a web browser.
