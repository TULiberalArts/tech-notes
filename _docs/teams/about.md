## What is Microsoft Teams?

[Microsoft Teams][8] is a workspace for real-time collaboration and
communication, meetings, and file sharing. Teams serves as a hub for
collaborative teamwork in [Microsoft 365][7] and is commonly used to chat
directly with individuals or groups, share and edit files in real time,
and host audio & video calls. Think of Teams as a combination of Zoom,
Slack, and Dropbox all in one application.

You can find additional information about Teams in the [Teams FAQ](../faq).

### Who can use Teams?

Every active account holder at Temple University has access to Microsoft
365 which includes access to Microsoft Teams. Since Teams is linked
directly to your Temple University AccessNet username, your directory
information and free/busy status will be automatically visible and
available in Teams.

You can also collaborate with external university partners and colleagues by
inviting them to a shared team or adding them as a guest to a channel.

### What can Teams do?

Use teams to meet with students and collaborate with colleagues. With Teams you
can organize a meeting via video call, share and record your screen, and
preserve the meeting minutes in a shared Word document accessible to everyone
in the team.

With Teams you can:

- Start a Team for a research project to store and manage project files
  and related correspondence.
- Create a Team to use with students in class to support live chat,
  allowing students to engage directly with the topic of each class.
- Use a Team to hold virtual "office hours" with students.
- Hold committee meetings and plan coursework all in one location.
- Collaborate with external colleagues at another institution by [adding
  them as a guest][19] or inviting them to a shared channel. 

### How do I get Teams?

You can begin using Teams on the Web right away by signing in with your
Temple University AccessNet account at
[teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com).

Teams for Desktop is automatically included on all Temple University
managed desktops and laptops, including all Liberal Arts managed
