Microsoft Teams can be accessed from any Internet connected device using a
[supported browser][3]. The latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari 10+, and Mozilla Firefox are all supported. For the best experience we recommend the latest version of [Microsoft Edge][2] which is included on all CLA supported desktops and laptops. 

In your web browser, navigate to
[https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com), enter your Temple
University email address (accessnet@temple.edu) and click 'Next'.

![]({{ '/assets/img/microsoft-login.png' | relative_url }})

After clicking 'Next' you will be redirected to Temple's Single Sign-On page.
Enter your Temple University AccessNet username and password and click 'Login'.
Please visit the [TUsecure website][1] for account self-service options if
you have difficulty signing in or forget your Temple University password. 

![]({{ '/assets/img/tu-sso-login.png' | relative_url }})

Once successfully signed in you may be prompted to "Stay signed in?". You can
select either 'Yes' or 'No'. Selecting 'Yes' will make future logins simpler.

![]({{ '/assets/img/microsoft-stay-signed-in.png' | relative_url }})

You can now begin using Microsoft Teams in your browser.
