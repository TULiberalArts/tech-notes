## What is a Team?

A team is a place where you can invite others to collaborate. Think of a team
as a group of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests.

Each team is connected to one or more SharePoint sites. These sites are
where the team's files are stored. In addition to SharePoint, each team is
connected to other tools that you can use to collaborate with others via
"Apps".

A Team can be Public or Private. A public team is a team that anyone in
the organization can join. Public teams do not require a team owner to
invite someone to the team. A private team is a team that a person can
only join when invited by a team owner. Both public teams and private
teams offer the same channel types - standard, private, and shared.

## What is SharePoint?

SharePoint is a tool for creating web sites, publishing content, and
storing files. SharePoint serves as the file storage backend for teams. If
you're only using Teams to chat and share files you will likely not have
a need to interact directly with SharePoint.  

## What is a SharePoint Site?

A SharePoint site is a web site in SharePoint where you can create web
pages and store and collaborate on files. SharePoint sites can be used
independently and are also used by Teams for file storage (these are
called Teams-connected sites). A Teams-connected site is created
automatically whenever you create a team.

## What are Channels in Teams?

A channel is a location within a team where you can collaborate with
others on a specific topic. A team can have multiple channels for
different purposes. For example, you might have a team for your department
with different channels covering different research groups, events, or
committees. Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, and
work on files together.

It’s important to remember that channels do not have a membership. You
don’t “join” a channel. You join a team. Once you are a member of a team,
you can see all the channels in it unless they are hidden. 

### Channel Types

There are three types of channels in Teams: standard, private, and shared.

**Standard** - A standard channel is a channel that all members of
a team have access to. Each team comes with a standard channel called
"General." Team owners and members can add additional standard channels.

**Private** - A private channel is a channel that only some of the team's members have
access to. It is used for private conversations and collaboration. Each
private channel has its own SharePoint site for file storage. Only members
of the private channel can access this site and the files within.

**Shared** - A new feature in Teams is the shared channel. This is a channel that
allows for easier collaboration with internal or external guests. A shared
channel is similar to a private channel in that each shared channel has
its own SharePoint site for file storage. Only members of the shared
channel can access this site and the files within.

## What is the Posts Tab?

The Posts tab is where you post anything you want to say to channel
members. This is the main chat interface for

a message to multiple channels][18].

## What is the Files Tab?

Files that you upload to a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint
folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each
channel.

Files that you upload to a one-on-one or group chat are stored in your
OneDrive for Business folder and are shared only with the people in that
conversation. These are available in the Files tab at the top of a chat.

When you upload a file to Teams it is automatically made available to
other members of the team. This means multiple people can collaborate on
a file at the same time during a Teams meeting.

Learn more about [collaborating on files in Teams][14] and how to [share
files using Teams][15].

## What are Apps?

Apps let you do more in Teams. Apps are a way to enhance the functionalit
of a team by integrating a third-party service or using an additional
service running in Microsoft 365. Many of the third-party tools, files,
and dashboards your department already uses can be added right into Teams.

Learn more about [using Apps in Microsoft Teams][9].

## What is Chat in Teams?

Chat lets you have a private 1:1 conversation with a student or colleague.
You can jump directly into a Teams call, video chat, or add additional
guests to your private chat. Of course, you can also use these same
features from your [Teams mobile app][5] on iOS and Android devices.

Think of Chat as a direct way to message individuals or groups without
everyone needing to first become a member of a Team.

Learn more about [starting a chat in Teams][10].

## What is the Calendar in Teams?

The Calendar app in Teams shows your personal Microsoft 365 calendar. This
is the same calendar that is available to you via Outlook desktop or
Outlook on the Web.

To create a Teams meeting, click on Calendar, then New Meeting. Fill out
the Details form and click Send. Teams will automatically add a meeting
URL to the body of the calendar invitation message that will allow
attendees to join the meeting. 

By default, you can invite anyone to a meeting, even if they are not
members of your organization. When it's time to join, clicking on the URL
in the invitation offers the opportunity to launch or download the Teams
app, or join using a web browser.
