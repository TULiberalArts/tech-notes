Geographic Information System (GIS) software empowers us to visualize, query
and analyze geographic data.

ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online are industry standard GIS applications from
[Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)][1].

Through a site license with ESRI, the College of Liberal Arts provides all
actively enrolled students, faculty, and staff at Temple University access to
ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.

If you require assistance with additional ESRI services, software, or
licensing, please submit a [TUhelp request]({{ '/get-help' | relative_url }}).
