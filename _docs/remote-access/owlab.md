## What is Owlab?

[Owlab][1] allows Temple University students, faculty, and staff
remote access to a TECHcenter-like virtual machine in the cloud.

With Owlab you can connect to a Windows computer running in the cloud
from another Windows or Mac computer from on or off campus.

## Who can access Owlab?

Students, faculty, and staff with an active AccessNet account have access to
Owlab at Temple University. If you believe you should have access but are
unable to sign in to the Owlab website, please [submit a TUhelp request][2] to
request access. Non-employees will need to specify the business need for access
to the resource and include a written endorsement of an administrative or
faculty sponsor with the request.
