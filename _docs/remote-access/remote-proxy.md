## What is Remote Proxy?

[Remote Proxy][1] allows eligible members of Temple University remote access to
their office computer from off campus.

With Remote Proxy you can connect to a Windows computer located on campus from
another Windows or Mac computer off campus. To connect to a Mac computer on
campus, [additional steps are required][5].

## Who can access Remote Proxy?

Most employees and some additional audiences have access to Remote Proxy at
Temple University. If you believe you should have access but are unable to sign
in to the Remote Proxy website, please [submit a TUhelp
request](https://tuhelp.temple.edu) to request access. Non-employees will need
to specify the business need for access to the resource and include a written
endorsement of an administrative or faculty sponsor with the request.

## How to access Remote Proxy?

#### Prerequisites

If you have not already signed up for [Multi-Factor Authentication][3] you
will need to do so to access the remote proxy website.

**Note:** If you are connecting to your Windows office computer from
a Mac, download and install [Microsoft Remote Desktop][6] from the Mac App
store before you begin. This is a free download.

#### Connecting

1. Visit [https://remoteproxy.temple.edu][1] in your browser, enter your
   AccessNet username and password and click **Log On**.

2. Complete the Multifactor authentication process. For more information,
   see the [Multifactor Authentication website][3].

3. If you have already connected to your office computer using this
   process, skip to step 6. Otherwise, click **Bookmark** near the top of
   the screen.

4. On the **Add a Bookmark** screen, perform the following:
 
    - In the name box, **enter the computer name** of your office computer.

    - In the Address box, enter either `ComputerName.tu.temple.edu` or the IP
      address of your office computer, where `ComputerName` is the CLATag of
      your office PC. All PCs in Liberal Arts are named after their Asset Tag
      (known as a CLATag) which is the letters CLA followed by 5 digits (e.g.
      `CLA12345`). The CLATag is a small sticker that includes the College of
      Libearl Arts logo and a barcode and is affixed directly to the computer
      (not on the monitor).

      Alternatively you can specify the IP address of your office PC. If you do
      not know the IP address, use this self-service link to see the IP
      addresses of the computers you have used recently.

      Note: If you do not know the IP address, use this self-service link to
      see the IP addresses of the computers you have used recently.

    - Click **RDP link** to place a checkmark in the box.

    - In the Name box, **enter a name for the bookmark**, such as *My Office Computer*.

    - In the Description box, **enter an optional description**, such as Windows.

    - Click **Save**.

5. You will now see the bookmark you just created. Use your mouse to hover over
   this bookmark. Information will appear in a pop-up window above the bookmark
   and on the lower left portion of the screen. Verify that this information
   reflects what you entered. 
   
   Note: If you notice that any of the information is not correct, click the
   Remove button. Then when prompted to remove bookmarks, click the check mark
   next to your IP address (e.g, `rdp://123.456.78.901`) and click Remove. You
   can then return to step 3 to start over.

6. Assuming everything is correct, **click the bookmark** you created.

7. You may be prompted to save a file to your computer. Otherwise, it will be
   downloaded automatically to your Downloads folder. The file begins with app
   and ends in .rdp (e.g., `app_15842938212.rdp`). If you are using the Chrome
   or Safari web browser, the file will appear on the lower-left/bottom-left
   corner of the browser. If you are using Microsoft Edge or Firefox, the
   downloaded file will appear on the upper-right/top-right corner of the
   browser. Click on this file to begin the remote connection process.

8. If you receive a warning prompting you if you would like to connect:

    - Click the check box next to Don't ask me again for connections to this
      computer.

    - Then click **Connect**.

9. A login screen for your remote computer appears.

    - If you are using a Windows computer to log in, the username might be
      pre-filled. If so, just enter your AccessNet password and click OK.

    - If your password isn't working, click **Use another account** and type the
      following in the username field **TU\accessnet**. Type your password in the
      password field.
      
    - If you are using a Mac to log in, a different log in screen appears. Enter
      your username and password
