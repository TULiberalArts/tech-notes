## Help in a Classroom

For help in a classroom, press the **Help Button** located on the podium
touch-screen control system.

Pressing the help button will immediately alert Classroom Technical Support
(CTS) staff. Classrooms across campus are supported by CTS staff who are based
out of offices close to the locations they support.

Computer labs located within the College Liberal Arts are directly supported by
Liberal Arts Information Technology staff (CLA IT). CLA IT offices are located
in the front of the Mazur Hall walk-in computer lab in room 21.

The Technology Support Center (TSC) is located on the ground floor of the TECH
Center in room 106 of the Bell Building at [N. 12th Street and Montgomery
